    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to explore Washington DC housing market data and gather initial findings. From these findings, we will reconfigure and group the Washington DC regions according to various housing statistics. Upon reconfiguration, these regions will then show similar/same sale prices and other housing characteristics. This analysis will be the basis of future evaluation including building predictive models to predict future home sale price and other notable housing market variables."

    "## Testing and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reconfigure the Washington DC regions, we perform multiple hypothesis testings to ensure the certain regions share the same housing charisteristics. In our project, we forcus on three variables: Median Sale Prices, Homes Sold Month-over-Month, and Inventory Month-over-Month. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the different tests we ran on our selected Washington DC housing market variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two-sample T test with unequal variance to test the means between two regions\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kolmogorov Smirnov test to test the distributions between two regions\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wilcoxon Rank test to test the difference for two population mean ranks from two regions\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mann-Whitney rank test to test if a random sample from one region is different than another one \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kendall Tau test to test if two samples are independent\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on time-series dataset we have, there is a relationship over time for each feature. Therefore, pratical speaking, we relax our testing assumption that each sample (region) is indepedent within each sample. In addition, we will confirm if two samples are independent of each other based on Kendall Tau test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exhaustive Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform a pairwise test among 82 regions for each testing methodology. Under the current size, there are over 3,300 comparions (82 choose 2). Therefore, we run the tests in a loop based on the 'combine_list'. In addition, there is a concern for the significance level since we use simultaneous hypothesis testing. To resolve this, we define our significance level $\\alpha = .000001$ within each test. The significance level would be less than .01 since $( 1-\\alpha)^{10000} > .99$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for the current approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is difficult to test two time series samples given the nature of dependency. Therefore, as mentioned in the assumption section, we relax the independence assumption. In addition, we will use the results from non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank test, Mann-Whitney rank, Kendall Tau test since we don't want to check the normality assumption from Two-sample T test and Kolmogorov Smirnov test doesn't take time factor into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine the test results from all three non-parametric tests to properly decide which two regions should be combined. "

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, we reconfigured regions based on (1) Wilcoxon rank test, (2) Mann-Whitney rank, and (3) Kendall Tau test. First, we confirm if regions are independent based on Kendall Tau test. Next, based on the testing statistics from Wilcoxon rank test, Mann-Whitney rank, we conclude that regions should be reconfigured. There are three housing statistics/features tested in our analysis: Median Home Sale Price, Homes Sold Month-over-Month, and Inventory Month-over-Month. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analysis on Median Home Sale Price, our claim is reassured that some regions share the same home sale prices. For example, four regions should be reconfigured: (1) American University Park / Friendship Heights / Tenleytown, (2) Chevy Chase-DC (3) Foxhall Village, and (4) Southeast Chevy Chase. However, based on the analyses for the Homes Sold Month-over-Month and Inventory Month-over-Month, it is not statistically significant to show that there is a difference among these four regions. Therefore, we recommend that additional investigation be done there."
