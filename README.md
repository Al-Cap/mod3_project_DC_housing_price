# Module 3 project: DC housing price

**Project Members:** 

Nate Lu and Michael Pallante

## Project Goal:

The goal of this analysis is to reconfigure and group the Washington DC regions according to various housing statistics.

Upon reconfiguration, these regions will then show similar/same sale prices and other housing characteristics.

## Summary of Data:

This analysis uses housing market data from the time period of February 2012 to October 2019, including data for prices (median sale price, percentage of homes sold above list price, percentage of homes that had price drop, etc.), inventory (number of homes on market, new listings, months of supply, etc.), and sales (number of homes sold, median days on market, etc.).

## Data Visualization 
The data visualization section produces the final outputs used in the presentation. We define the profit in two senses: (1) pure profit (domestic gross - movie budge), and (2) dollor returns. It includes the comparisions between profit and major attributes: diretors, writers, and genres. In addition, we concludes that the imdb rating is not a good indicator to make most profitible movie.
